# Chillwheel - A Map of Bike Accidents and Stolen Bikes
Chillwheel is a web app that allows users to view, report, and search for bike accidents and stolen bikes in their area. With Chillwheel, you can stay up-to-date on the latest bike safety information, and help others recover their stolen bikes.

Built with Ruby on Rails, Chillwheel offers a simple, intuitive interface that makes it easy to browse and search for incidents in your area. You can also use Chillwheel to report new incidents, or to contact the owner of a stolen bike if you have information that can help.

## Features
Map view: View incidents on a map, and see details about each incident, including location, date, and description.
Search and filter: Use the search bar and filters to find specific incidents, or to view incidents within a specific area or time frame.
Report an incident: Use the report form to add new incidents to the map, and help others stay informed about bike safety in your area.
Contact the owner: If you have information about a stolen bike, you can use the contact form to get in touch with the owner and help them recover their bike.
